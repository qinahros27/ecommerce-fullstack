## Requirements

1. Apply CLEAN architecture in your backend. In README file, explain the architecture of your project as well.
2. Implement Error Handling Middleware: This will ensure any exceptions thrown in your application are handled appropriately and helpful error messages are returned.
3. Document with Swagger: Make sure to annotate your API endpoints and generate a Swagger UI for easier testing and documentation.
4. Project should have proper file structure, naming convention, and comply with Rest API.
5. `README` file should sufficiently describe the project, as well as the deployment.

1. Web Api layer:
   - Authorization Requirement
   - Configuration

## Getting Started
Clone the respository from github: git clone

<!-- This is the deploy link for the backend from Azure: [BackEnd Link](https://ecommerce-backend-fs15.azurewebsites.net) -->

<!-- Using this link plus the proper endpoint to retrieve the data. -->

<!-- This is the netlify deploy link for the frontend: [FrontEnd Link](https://anhnguyenecommerce.netlify.app/) -->

The front-end now just have some basic function: 
1. Show all products , and filter product by category and price
2. Show product detail
3. Add product to cart
4. Log in and Sign Up
5. Manage products ( For user role Admin) : Add, edit, delete

<!-- Note: If you navigate to the front-end link and see nothing (One tip: you can run one of the backend links first, such as [this](https://ecommerce-backend-fs15.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/products), and if it works, then run the frontend link again), that is because the server has an internal error. I encountered this problem, and after restarting the server, it worked normally. I think the reason for that is maybe because of sending many requests in a short time, so the server crashes. However, I will figure out how to solve this bug and add more functions for the frontend. By now, these are what I have. -->

## Testing

Unit testing, and optionally integration testing, must be included for both frontend and backend code. Aim for high test coverage and ensure all major functionalities are covered.
